# adaptive-documents

## TODO
* path to css file may change
* handle case where there is no container defined
* handle case where no items defined
* apply different styles depending on element type
* get content using innerHTML rather than innerText
* need easy way to toggle between adaptive/non-adaptive
* clicking 'up' on first item in list should move to last item and vice-versa
* allow focusing on a sub-item (hide rest of items including parent)
* needs a search feature
* work out parent from name of id, eg parent of '1.2.3' is '1.2'
* better errors if assertions fail (eg which link isn't valid? which ids aren't unique?)
